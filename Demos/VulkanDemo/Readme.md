# VulkanDemo

Run Vulkan from C# / Windows Forms / .NET6

The rendering is done in the Panel (`panelVulkan`).

Demo objectives:
- PoC
- Display JPG/PNG as a large texture with tessellation
- Display different geometric primitives of different colors and with semitransparency on top of the texture
- Output FPS
